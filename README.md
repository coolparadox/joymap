# joymap

Joymap is a script for applying button remapping to game controllers built around jscal utility from [Linux Console Project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxconsole/). I wrote it so I could make my PS3 controllers pleasant to use with Linux games that don't offer button remapping for controllers.

This is very early coding; still have to document how to add button definitions for other controllers, as well as how to add button remapping for games.
